# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life implemented using WebGPU compute shaders. Programmed in Rust using the wgpu crate.
Can be compiled and run natively using ```cargo run --release```, or compiled to WASM and run in the web.

WASM version can be demoed at https://portfolio.agreenweb.com/gol. Click the "?" in the top right of the window for input instructions. Because this uses compute shaders, it requires a browser that supports WebGPU to run (https://caniuse.com/webgpu).

If you want to test this in the web yourself, build using ```wasm-pack build --target web```, then use a server to serve index.html, index.js, and the pkg folder. Compiling to WASM requires that the RUSTFLAGS environment variable is set to ```RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis cargo run```.

This was created for my own learning. I wanted to learn WebGPU/GPU Programming/GPU Compute, also wanted to test an idea I've had about updating each cell in Conway's Game of Life in parallel. 
On my machine(RTX 3090Ti) it seems to run many times faster than the other web-based Game of Life implementations I've found, and it's completely unoptimized. 
Currently in the compute shader I just count the number of neighbors and write a new color for each cell, there are way fancier, faster algorithms for Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Currenly running Highlife(B36/S23) instead of traditional GOL(B3/S23). Rules are in gol_shader1.wgsl, feel free to change them.
